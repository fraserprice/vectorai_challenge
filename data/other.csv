They do not!
They do to!
I hope so.
She okay?
Let's go.
Wow
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
No
I\'m kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don\'t know how to quit?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
The "real you".
What good stuff?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What crap?
do you listen to this crap?
No...
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you\'re gonna look like an extra on 90210."
You always been this selfish?
But
Then that's all you had to say.
Well, no...
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
I was?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Tons
Have fun tonight?
I believe we share an art instructor
You know Chastity?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Hi.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
She's not a...
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Sure have.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You're sweet.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You got something on your mind?
Where?
There.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
That's because it's such a nice one.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Let me see what I can do.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
That's a shame.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Why?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Cameron.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Forget it.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
I did.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Is he oily or dry?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Great
Joey.
Who?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
You might wanna think about it
No.
Did you change your hair?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Hi, Joey.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Neat...
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Queen Harry?
So yeah, I\'ve got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that\'s gonna be huge.  And then I\'m up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Hopefully.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Expensive?
It's more
Perm?
Patrick -- is that- a.
It's just you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
I just wanted --
You set me up.
Let go!
So did you
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
That's not
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
After that, I swore I\'d never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven\'t since. Except for Bogey\'s party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
But
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
As in...
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But you hate Joey
He was, like, a total babe
Why?
In 9th.  For a month
What?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Like you care.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
You're welcome.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What's normal?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What do you think?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Where've you been?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
I'm missing something.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
He\'s not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
No, but
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Because she'll scare them away.
Why?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Just for a minute
Daddy, no!
Wear the belly before you go.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
It\'s just a party. Daddy, but I knew you\'d forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn\'t going --
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
And where're you going?
Daddy, I --
Exactly my point
But she doesn't want to date.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
What if she never starts dating?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Just sent 'em through.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Never
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
No, I ' m not.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
You told me that part already.
It's her favorite band.
Assail your ears for one night.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
He's pretty!
Dead at forty-one.
Her favorite uncle
It's a lung cancer issue
Number one.  She hates smokers
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Will Bogey get bent?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
You got him involved?
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
I thought you hated those people.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
That's what I just said
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
He seems like he thrives on danger
What makes you think he'll do it?
You wanna go out with him?
What about him?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You know French?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why not?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Who is she?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
That girl -- I --
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That I'm used to.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
How many people go here?
Get out!
Thirty-two.
How many people were in your old school?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
So -- which Dakota you from?
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So they tell me...
You the new guy?
You get the girl.
What's the worst?
Where?
She kissed me.
You makin' any headway?
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
What'd you do to her?
Then, go get her
Sure
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
She's partial to Joey, not me
What 're you talking about?
It's off. The whole thing.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Don't make me do it, man
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
What've you got for me?
Yeah -- we'll see.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
And why would I do that?
Leave my sister alone.
Your sister here?
Away.
Where ya goin?
Not at all
Hey -- do you mind?
They're running the rest of me next month.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Get her to act like a human
Do what?
How'd you do it?
A deal's a deal.
It's about time.
Forget her sister, then.
Forget it.
A hundred bucks a date.
What?
I just upped my price
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I'm on it
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Fine, thirty.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
How much?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Two legs, nice rack...
What do you think?
Yeah
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You and Verona?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
We're not.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We don't chat.
Nope - just came by to chat
Are you lost?
Hey.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Who?
Have you seen him?
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
You didn't
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I didn't have a choice.
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Who cares?
What'd he say?
No fear.
You think this'll work?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don\'t forget your tiara."
Does it matter?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Neither has his heterosexuality.
That's never been proven
William didn't even go to high school
William would never have gone to a state school.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
An attempted slit.
What's this?
Just a little.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Block E?
He always look so
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Who's that?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Because I like to torture you.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Is that right?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I didn't care about the money.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
It wasn't like that.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Wait I...
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
That ' s completely adorable!
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
What?
My grandmother's .
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
Oh huh
It's just something I had.  You know
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Answer the question, Patrick
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Why not?
No, I won't go with you
No what?
No.
You know what I mean
Is that a request or a command?
Go to the prom with me
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No one else knows
What?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
I hate peas.
Tell me something true.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Hearsay.
The duck?
Fallacy.
State trooper?
For. . . ?
You up for it?
You never disappointed me.
How?
Then you screwed up
Something like that
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Yes
Acting the way we do.
So what's your excuse?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
A soft side? Who knew?
I dazzled him with my wit
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Good call.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
The Partridge Family?
Maybe.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Put your right foot there --
Try lookin' at it from this angle
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Look up, sunshine
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Unwelcome.
Wholesome.
Pleasant?
You 're so --
I heard there was a poetry reading.
What are you doing here?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
BIANCA
Who?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
I'm gettin' there
Oh, so now you think you know me?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Start a band?
This.
Do what?
I should do this.
Why'd you lie?
Then why'd you ask?
No, you weren't
Maybe.
Were you in jail?
Busy
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
And I'm in control of it.
What?
Kat! Wake up!
You know what they say
I thought you were above all that
Hey man. . .  You don \' t think I can be "cool"?  You don\'t think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I hate him.
Dorsey.
Who?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Just let me sit down.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Like you could find one
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Why?
Sure, I do
You don't care if I die
I told you
Why 're you doing this?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
This is so patronizing.
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
I know, just let me sleep
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I just need to lie down for awhile
You're not okay.
I'm fine. I'm
Okay?
Funny, you're the only one
I say, do what you wanna do.
"I\'m getting trashed, man." Isn\'t that what you\'re supposed to do at a party?
What's this?
Why, don't you?
You know who The Raincoats are?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Excuse me?

hey.  Great show, huh?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Hi
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Are you following me?
Seven-thirty?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
And why would I do that?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You hate me don't you?
I know a lot more than that
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Pick you up Friday, then
My mission in life.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
When I go?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
No -- impressed.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Bianca did what?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Which parts?
Parts of it.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
No, Daddy.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Funny.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Was that your sister?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
So what I want doesn't matter?
As a parent, that's my right
Because you're making decisions for me.
Why can't we agree on this?
I thought you were punishing me.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Enough!
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
You decided.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I know.
Just smack her now.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Tempestuous?
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Yeah...
Kat a fan, too?
Right.
Macbeth, right?
Oh yeah.
You think?
Yeah.  I guess.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Hi.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
You were right. She's still pissed.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I'm likin' you guys better
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Yeah.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Just for now.
Are you telling me I\'m a -  "non-smoker"?
Good enough.
What?!
We're your guys.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What plan?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What?
Say it
See you next week!
You're completely demented.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What's to discuss?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Touch of the flu.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
With the teeth of your zipper?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
I missed you.
That ' s what I thought
Absolutely not.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Your daughters went to the prom.
What just happened?
But -- who -- what --?
Have a great time, honey!
Dr. Ruth?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Pirate -- no question.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
You're not helping.
Tumescent!
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Make anyone cry today?
In the microwave.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We should have seen land.
We'll all go crazy...
He's the devil's child...
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Your life, and that of others!
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Excellency, you are right.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
I am, Your Eminence
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You can see for yourself.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
The Judgment is ours!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I am busy inside.
Can't you stay with us a little?
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
They took everything...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
You don't usually ask.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
That's something you can't decide.
I don't want you to wait for me.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Thank God...
She said yes.
I find that hard to believe.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Are we going to argue?
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I haven't given you much of a life.
I know.
I could be gone for years.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
How far from here?
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Appointment to what?
My letters of appointment.
Yes... I remember...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
May I ask by whom?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
What does he say?
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What are you listening to?
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Father...
Not bad.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
This time with me!
I have to explore the mainland.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
There'll be a time.
I want to go with you!
All of them created by people like me.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
What do you see?
Look out of that window.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Call them.
All I have to do is call the guards.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
... for a commoner?
You defend yourself admirably...
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
Then you are too ambitious.
I'm not bargaining!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
No?
No...
You never learned how to speak my language.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
You did the same to your God!
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Ask him if he will help.
He understands.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
Chief says...
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says -- he has a God.
To bring the word of God.
Why?
Thousands.
Chief says -- how many?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief knows.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
You come!  You speak first!
Island.  Far.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Say not here!  Cuba!
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
Oh?  So you are a new man?
New worlds create new people.
I knew you would.
I have to disagree.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I suppose we're both old men now.
Give me absolution.
I believed in you...
You are bound by an oath, Father.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
How long?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
What are you saying?
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I am listening, my son.
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Colon!  Don't!
All of them!  Just lies!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Colon!
Damn God!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Passion is something one cannot control!
Father Marchena!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
So was Christ!
Esdras is a Jew.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
How can you be so certain?
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Why do you wish to sail west?
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
How did you manage it?
That's what it says.
God... That's in a week!
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Thank you.
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Do they have such thoughts?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
A woman?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn\'t accept the world as it is.  Who\'s not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
May I speak freely?
Surely you can do anything you want.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
That she was impregnable.
What did they say about Granada before today?
The ocean is uncrossable?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
You will regret this.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
My horse doesn't work.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We don't need to know.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We can't be.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
What's he doing?
Twenty eight.
What do you read?
Come over here.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
And what do you think Mendez?
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
God be with us admiral.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
You're right.  Let the men decide.
You tell that to them!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You bloody...
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
The land is there.  I know it!
We're lost!
You think I don't know that?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You must be mad...!
Six days ago, yes.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Immediately.
Where can I meet this man?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Then why?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
He must be replaced.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
... Into a monk...
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your mother was blind?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Give me another one, please.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
What else do you need?
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
But it's...
No.  No way.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
What's your cut?  How much?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What about Oleg?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I was all of these.
...delusions and paranoia.
Oh, sure.
You bring the cigarettes?
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Here.  I have your money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Daphne, I...
I don't want to drag you down with me.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Pouring it out!
What are you doing?
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Do you have coffee?
Right.
You better get packed.
I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Is he your boyfriend?
I'm sorry.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
They're not gonna send you right back.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I know.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
What are you asking me?
So you were never a prostitute?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
No.
What about back home?
No.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
Yes, I considered it.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yeah.  This way.
So...the station is empty?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Somewhere else?
I can't take you to my place.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Divorced.
Are you married?
They won't until this is over.
I will if they don't send me back.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Now I become custody of police department?
Yes, but he was a cop.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
A cop?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Go on.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
It was my decision, not his.
Oh.
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
But Chief?  Over this??
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
End my career?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
No!  Nothing happened.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
I let her take a shower.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Who did cause and origin?
Yeah.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah, right.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.  I'm okay.
Are you hit?
Stay with her.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Yeah.
Only one guys checked in?
It's okay.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Any I.D.?
Takin' a bath.
Where is she?
A timer.
What's he looking for?
You ready?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
When?
I'm gonna propose.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Vodka tonic.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Describe him.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
What are you saying?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
Did you tell him you did?
No.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
What's wrong?
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who's there?
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Just a shower?
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
You know what I'm saying here.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
I don't have a girlfriend.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Yeah.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Raw deal.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Something back home?
Why not?
Is that all there is?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Of course.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm on duty.
You thirsty?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Better than one.
Two heads.
I'll call it... tails.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll let you know what happens.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Mind if I ride along with you?
You got any better ideas?
You goin' to the escort service?
Stay here.
My folks are.
You're Polish?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
This isn't homicide school.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll come with you.
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
What would you call her?
Who says she's a suspect?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Hmmmm.
Pretty.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
I don't even watch TV.
Nah, why should you?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Watch the news?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
No, what is it?
You know what that is, right?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Then do it, asshole.
I kill someone famous.
What's your accomplishment.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What do you want?
So...who's Nicky?
Don't be late.
Thank you.
See you later.  Good luck.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah.  I promise.
You promise?
Tonight.
Okay, til tonight.
I love you.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Promise?
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.
That's good.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Answer it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Could be Leon's.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
You're not so bad yourself.
You're ruthless.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
I'm not.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Stop it.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Hey.
Hey, honey.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Is it drug related?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
There are two bodies found at this point.
How many victims are up there?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Any chance we can do that again?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Okay.  You ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Ready?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
That's unique.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Not what.  Who.
So what's unique?
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
How old are your kids?
I'm not moody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Jesus Christ.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
No.  Are you proposing?
Are you married?
Dog food.
And what do you do with the bones?
You stuff sausage in it.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
I am butcher.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Tell him to put his gun down!
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Where's your partner?
Get down on your knees.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
You'll be my first.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Tommy, take a walk.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Give me the address!!
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Where is escort service?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Where's Czech girl?
Hi, I'm Honey.
He doesn't speak English.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Two weeks.
How long are you planning to stay?
We are both from Prague.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Is there a problem?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Yes.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
I have five-hundred dollars.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks holiday.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Yes sir.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Yes.  Both.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
In here, says he wants a million.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
This all you want?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Who is he?
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Traitor!!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
No, I don't get that!
You got that?
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Credit?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Be quiet.  Watch.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Shut up.  Look!
I'm serious.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Cut!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Good idea!
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Sit down!
Let me get a shot of it.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
What is that?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Why not?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
I did.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What is it?
Don't want to film this?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Does it hurt?
Shut up.
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Get in the bathroom!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whore?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
How you erase this?
You said speak Czech!
Speak English!
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Turn that fucking thing off!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
What?
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
We have no money.  Come on.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Don't speak Russian!
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
I want to document my trip to America.
Did you hear what I said?
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
We started over, you can too.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
It's easy to learn.
As a plumber?!
Yes, the money is good.
A job?
I can get you a job.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Ha. Ha.
We spent it!
Milos.  Get my money!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Did you hurt her?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Emil???!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You've got a call.
What are you doing here?
Robert...?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Yeah?
In love?  With who?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Isn't he a little moody?
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Alright.  Go ahead.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
Well, he...
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I know.
Excuse me?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It\'s a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
I'm here for movies.
What are you coming here to do?
A cheap hotel.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
New York.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
I speak English.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes...he's my friend.
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Well, he killed my partner!
He's my collar!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
No way!  He's mine!
I'll take him.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
What was that?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
That's what it looks like to me.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
No.  Go ahead.
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You okay?
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Yeah?  What kind?
I used an accelerant.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
What the hell happened?
Get outta here!
Not good.
How was it?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Aren't you tired?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
You hear that question, Garcia?
How long they been livin' here?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Yeah?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
What?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What??
He knew all along.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
But you knew that, right?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
Don't blow your nose!
Clean?
Mouth's clean, too.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Oh yeah, why?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Don't stoop to his level!
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
What are you gonna do?
The clerk?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Your doctor?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
CONTINUED
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED
She's wonderful.
CONTINUED
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Roger.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I guess not.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
It's the last one.
Yes.
Hal?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Two more.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
No.
You're kidding.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Are you reasonably awake?
Good morning. How's it going?
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well, that's something.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
But not completely inconceivable?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
That's true.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
How?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, I thought so.
That seems very unlikely.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Oh?
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
No. I never did, either.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
It's possible.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Yes.
Really.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Yes?
It's about my salary cheques.
What's up?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Sure, what is it?
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Okay, come on down.
Okay. 
Right. Just a sec.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Yes, it is.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
And don't you worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
What is it, Hal?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
He's got a point.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
CONTINUED
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
CONTINUED
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONINUED
Well, what is it?
CONTINUED
Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED
Goodbye, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Yes, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Thank you, Daddy.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
She's in the bathroom.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
In three days, darling, I hope.
When are you coming home?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Are you coming to my party?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'll bet it's a fortune.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, how's it going back there?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, that does sound very odd.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, where are all of you off to?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
How is gregor?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
And your charming little daughter?
Yes, it's coming along very well.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Fine.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Certainly.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, I'm glad about that.
Fortunately, they did.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
I see.
That's right.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Really?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you quite sure?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Any ideas about the colour?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Any clue as to what it is?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
What do you mean?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Thank you.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Opening pod bay doors.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Roger.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
I understand.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Five by five, Frank.
Roger.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Thank you very much, Hal.
That's true.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true.
That's true.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
True.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
I will if I can, Frank.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
Great, just great.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
How about chargin' the battery?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah, I've been busy.
This is three years old.
Hammond.
Name?
I want to pick up my car.
Yeah?
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Now how's your memory doin'?
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Vodka.
Yeah.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Hey, what about me?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
I never paid for it in my life.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Pay money?
Pros.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I ain't tired yet.
I want to drive awhile.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Here you go, baby.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hello, again.
Here's hoping, baby...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
What's the matter with my place?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You're in a hurry.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Goodbye.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
I'm candy...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Where's ganz?
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
No chance.
You're gonna help us take him.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Would you guys...
I hear you've got visitors.
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
How about it?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You're done.  End of story.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You lying son of a bitch...
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Thanks.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You okay?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Partnership?
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Hey, there she is...
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Don't worry about it.
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Luther's on the move...
Why?
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
That was quick.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Yeah, I see her.
Yeah. Guess not.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
You sure that's the reason?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
So you took the rest of the night off...
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don\'t Distur sign.  He\'s trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
We missed.
What about Ganz?
What about Luther?
Hello. And goodbye.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Where's luther?
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
No way...
You stay with me...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
No class...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
What?
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Shit.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You just drove by it.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Where's the goddamn car?
Yeah.  Right.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Right, partner.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Where's the money?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Not likely, convict.
We split 50-50?
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
He's after your money.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Just tell me about the money.
Jesus.
Half a million.
How much?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
They saved your ass, convict.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Let's go.
Come on.
Must be billy's girl.
There.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
You made that move, huh?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
The bet's off.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
What are you talkin' about?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
That's never been one of my problems.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Hey, you wanna bet?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Well?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
You have a good time?
Last night.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
I don't give out the details.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Now, where we goin', convict?
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
We eat when I say we eat.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn\'t get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
What do you think?
Want to try it again?
Thank you.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
I may call you worse than that.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Luther was part of the gang?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Yeah.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
No way to start a partnership.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I'll think about it.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Bullshit.
I got a lot to protect.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
You're crazy.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Yeah?
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Yeah, I noticed...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You here to write my life story?
Sure, anything you want.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You got a name, cop?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
I didn't have the time.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
What a screw-up.
You couldn't get to him?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Which one pulled the trigger?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
How did they get away?
I lost them, that's what happened.
What the bell happened?
I'll keep it in mind.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Yeah?
Jack?
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah...
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah, I read the report...
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Yeah.
That's what you say, Cates...
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
What?
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I got to wait for a call.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Bullshit red tape.
Nothing.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Doesn't look like it.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
So do you...been a long day.
You look awful.
One of  em's in the slam.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Who are all these?
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Billy Bear...
Shit.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
I'll help you out.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
When? How?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I don't know.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
A cop...
That's what I always say.
You're impossible...
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Tell me.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Where is he?
Three more hours...
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Let's go, Reggie.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Whaddya think?
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
So what?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
How do you know?
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
You real down?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Hiya, kid.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Fuck you.
Hi, it's me...
Hello.
Just a second, that's all!
Jack, wait...
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack?  What was that?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
So am I.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
No wonder you're so popular.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Jack, are you okay?
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
You made the front page.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Great place for lunch.
Guess people ought to know who I am...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
You sure you want me to?
Call me later.
That's the way I see it, too.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
I guess he got the message...
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
What'd you do?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What's wrong with that?
I'm all wet.
That's the way I see it, too.
You're hopeless.
Hey, you're right.
I still don't think it's loaded.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
What am I wanted for?
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
That's no bull.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How would you know?
Hard man to live with.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Who the hell are you?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Keep stallin'.
What do you want?
Stall.
Shut up.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
Hey...
Sure, right.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Yeah, old times.
We got a lot to talk about.
Can't complain.
How ya doin'?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How hot are they?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Rosalie, you okay?
First, the money.
Let her go.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You chickenshit punk...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
When?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Surprise, Luther.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Try and take it.
Give it back.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
This ain't a credit business.
Five.  On credit.
Five bills.
Don't mess with me. How much?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
How much?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How about some ammo?
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
You sure?
Naw, right here's okay.
You want to go outside?
Not bad, not bad.
How you doing, man?
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
You know exactly where they are!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
The case was stolen?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Napoleon... small.
What're you laughing about?
At your service.
Corn-i-Lius?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
I know...
You are a monster, Zorg!
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
They are robots!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
No thank you.
...would you like a drink?
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm fucked!
...We're saved!
That's what I'm saying.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
When is she not in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
What are you doing?
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Of course.
Good luck..
We have to save the world.
What kind of mission?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
That's what I thought.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's an exception..
They all like this in your family, father?
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
So you do know her.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
You noticed...
He's a she!
The girl?
I brought the girl remember?
Who are you?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What are we going to do?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Yes..thank God..
Is there anything that can stop it?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
And then?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Where's Leeloo?
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Perfect.
They really made her...
I didn't know your size.
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Yes. Of course..
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
What's she doing?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
What is?
It's a miracle!!!
They are... with me...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I would like to have died in peace...
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I don't have time... I need to know.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Do you love her?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Leeloo... is... she's...
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Who?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Leeloo..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
5\'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
So, just how big was this fare?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Hello?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Uh... at least fifty.
How many points you got left on your license?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
I don't need one.
Like shit.
How do I look?
I just found a picture of you.
Don't exist bud.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
At least, the cat comes back.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I was talking to the cat.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Hey bud! Finger here.
Yeah?
...Leeloo.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...What's your name?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Vito Cornelius?
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
...Priest...
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...'Scuse me?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
We will be ready, Lord.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
The Fifth Element...
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
...Ma???
You little sleaze bag!
Hello?
...Not yet.
Have you pulled yourself together?
Yeah?
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Other than that... You all right?
Yes ma..
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Hi Ma...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
...Hello?
Found it?
6... 5...
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
30 seconds...
This is a police control action..
I'm sorry..
Thanks for reminding me..
You have nine points left on your license..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Is that all?
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
What did you say? What did you do?
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
It's like a cab isn't it?
You know how to fly this thing?
I'll be right back.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Not without Leeloo.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
He's on vacation.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Got it...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Yeah, very big, a giant.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
I don't think this is a good time...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Crystal.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Uh... not really.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Does it get any better or what!
...Hi.
Oh, yes you will...
Three of us will never fit in there!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
I thought you were divorced.
It's my wife.
What is it?
...Shit!
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Why not?
I'm not going.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
I've had enough good news for today
Don't you open your messages?
You're the only one left alive...
And the third one?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
Just one... why me?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Where have I heard this song before?
To save the world.
What mission?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
I love you...
Tell me...
Because...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Exactly.
...Like love...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
I want to sleep... forever...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I'm so tired...
It's up to you now, Angel!
...The rain falls...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Protect life... Until death.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I'm so very sad.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
You're nothing but a... a...
It's difficult.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Where you going?
OK, you can turn around!
You noticed..
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You get that off the screen?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Here we go again...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
Uh...
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Apipoussan?
Apipoussan!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that\'s all I need.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
All 900.
Which one?
Learning language.
Finished what?
What is... Make Love?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Yes! But "love" isn\'t the operative word here, PEACE is!
Love...
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Apipoulai!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Oh god!
Cornelius..
You hear that?
Uh..you're welcome.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Apipoulai!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
At least I won lunch.
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Not going to open?
You're welcome..
Thanks..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not?
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Uh..
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Been here long?
The cash man!
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
This thing solid?
Wonderful!
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Talk English Doc.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Have you identified it?
Actually only one cell survived..
This is all that survived?
How much time is left?
They just landed in the desert.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
I want your best man on this!
...What do you mean?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Gentlemen?
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Recommendations.
Wait or act.
Options.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Is that better?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Staedert, do you read me?
To fame.. salud..
Drink!
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Amen..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
I'm not at the hotel!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Yes, Sir!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
...I can't wait to be among you.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
How's our deal coming along?
Got it.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
...Not far, now.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Am I disturbing you?
I just talked to her.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Tom... she's dead.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
What?
Mrs. Christian.
Who are you calling?
Amy...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Don't...
You're killing me...
I don't know what to say
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You should have.
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You don't understand...
You couldn't?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Tom...
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What happened to you?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
... What's going on?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Hello?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Why the gun?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
I know.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I understand.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
I love you.
I love you.
Honey, I'm not, please...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
How's the detective business?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Okay, I believe you.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I'm not accusing you...
You know, Amy, I\'ve been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Do you know how much I missed you?
Welcome home.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What you see is what I got, mister.
Snuff?
There's nothing harder.
Anything harder?
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
What are these?
I promised him to Machine.
What the fuck... !
Nobody knows anything.
Dino...
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
I'm telling you...
Bullshit.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
What are you talking about?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What do you want?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Friend of yours?
I remember him.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Look, I don't know what this...
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Take out your gun!
What are you... ?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Sure.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
What are these for?
They should be here any minute.
Where are the women?
Excellent.
Right here.
You brought the money?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Where's that?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Machine's in?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'm camera shy.
What's the problem?
I'd rather you didn't.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
We can do that.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Machine.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'll consider it.
I want to watch you work.
And they are?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Is it?
That's five thousand dollars.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
You said something about money.
Hmm.
A fellow investor.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
What can I do for you today?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You betrayed us.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
... sorry...
Fuck off.
Leave him alone.
You're a dead man.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Is that him?
It's good what you're doing.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Any good?
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
I'm not so sure about this.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Why don't they come to me?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
We do.
I figured you share information.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Alright, Tom.
Call me Tom.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
That\'s right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I never killed anyone.
Easy enough for you.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Don't think I won't.
Do it.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Where?  Show me where.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Show me where you buried her.
You got absolute zero.
Stop talking.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Keep moving.
Show me.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
What did you do with her body?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Tell me what happened.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
You enjoy it?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Because we're going there.
Why?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
What the fuck do you want from me?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Something like that.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
It was a lot of fucking money.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
How much did he pay you?
Yeah.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I told you, I don't know.
I want his name.
I don't know...
Who is Machine?
What do you want?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Fuck you!
Don't ask questions.
How'd you find me here?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I'm gonna kill you.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
What's he talking about?
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What the fuck are you.. ?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
Who is this.
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Yeah, who's this?
Eddie.
Celebrity Films.
Fuck you!
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Look, you cocksucker...
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
He's lying.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Give me the film.
You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film.
Fuck you.
You almost went over your limit.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Enlighten me.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
I'm asking.
You're asking me why?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're making me very angry.
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Shut your mouth and drive!
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut up.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
They're no friends of mine.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Never mind how I found you.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
I was well compensated.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
That's right.
You are a private investigator?
Of what sort?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
I'm listening.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
What's this?
Nope.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
What's next?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I\'d be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I know if I had to pick, it\'d be "Choke," or "Devil."
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
You don't need to be here.
Nobody knows his name.  That\'s his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that\'s what they call him.  Machine.
Who is he, his name?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Wha... ?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Great.
It's their Presidential Suite.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
See ya.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Alright, I get the picture.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Where does he sell it?
You're learning.
Specialty product.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Good question.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
A daughter.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
What about me?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I don't know, where are yours?
Where are your parents?
Twenty-five.
How old are you?
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Snuff films.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Child pornography.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Interesting theory.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
... Hello... ?
See you then.  Oh, and, don\'t call me "pops."
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Sounds good, pops.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
How much do you make now?
How much?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Not quite.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
I'm not a cop.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
There's not much illegal.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Max.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Three, four years.
How long you been working there?
Good for you.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Remember me?
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Truman Capote.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
I'll risk it.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Pardon me?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Yeah... guess so.
Big date tonight?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
How will I get it to you?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
Fine...
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
How are you?  Having any luck?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Hello?
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Okay.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I'm here.
Hello... ?
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
You're joking.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Okay, I follow you so far...
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm not positive this means anything.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Okay...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Nothing remotely like this.
You've found missing persons before.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
It won't work like that.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
You don't have any other choice.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You... you need to go to the police.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
I'm telling you it's not that.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
No.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you\'re talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There\'s no such thing, I can assure you.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
I'm afraid I don't...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
Just curious.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
He succeeded.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Pittsburgh?
I'll do whatever I can to help.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
My condolences.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
He's odd.
Thank you.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Uh huh, pleasure.
I try to be.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
No... no... no...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Who are you?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who is this... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
What... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
What are you talking about... ?
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
I remember.  You just left...
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Hello... ?
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
It's been six years.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Yes.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Will you let me look?
How... how can you say that to me...?
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
I don't know.  I think so.
Do you think the police did a good job?
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
What?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
You should be.
No.
Are you religious?
We're all like that.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Okay.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Of course.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I didn't mean to...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
It got to be too much for him.
Why do you think he did it?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Yes.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
I don't know.
What was she running from?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
No.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
That's exactly what I am.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
No.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
Neil... Neil Cole.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
Yes, but...
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
I don't understand, who are... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Yes... ?
I'll do what I can.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Her belongings?
Those are her belongings.
What is this?
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Do you know what happened to her?
Yes.  I remember her.
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes... I remember Mary
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
No, sir, he is not.
None too discreet, is he?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Certainly, sir.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Okay.  Fine.
No, you may not.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Cash.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Then we'll stay up together.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
We'll figure it out.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
I can't go back to sleep again.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I can't find him.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
It was bad.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Kristen...
You alright?
What?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
What's wrong?
Alice, you think you can leave?
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Rick...I can't.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
I don't want to.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
What?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Kristen, what happened?
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
You what?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
You could do worse.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I'm sure they're around.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Then you saw him, too?
That obvious, huh?
You've been up all night?
What?
We have matching luggage.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
I know.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
You in a hurry?
Save it for later.  Come on!
You look great!
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
What the hell was that?
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Here we are.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
It's okay, we're just about there.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
You just feel sorry for me.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Who?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Then what else can we do?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Is there something we can do?
Not really.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Three days.
How long have you been awake?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Extra money, huh?
I've been working double shifts.
Kristen's story really got to her.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
"In her dream"?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
You're his sister, right?
No...
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Enough of that crap.
It was Freddy.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Rick, please.
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
About Freddy?
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Been up with Alice.
She knew she was gonna die.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Nice neighborhood.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
So?
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Let me talk to you.
I don't get it.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Hey, Rick!
Earth to Alice...
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
I'm sorry honey, but...
Your distraught.  It'll help...
What's wrong with me?
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I'll tell you later.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Oh God!  He killed them!
What is it?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Don't worry, honey
You don't get it, he's after me...
You just stay put.  You need rest.
I gotta get out of here.
You had a nasty bump.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Feeling better now?
You're not taking my baby!
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
It's okay, Dan
Excuse us, dear.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
But how...?
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
What do you mean?
He's inside you, where he hides.
Where is he?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Mommy...?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Who says I don't like you?
Who said I...wait, what?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
She doesn't want me around
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No...
Is that who you're waiting for?
Been having bad dreams.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
How did you know that?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
My name is...
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Huh?
Hey...wake up.
Me too.
There you go.  Love you.
You're right.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Yeah...I guess.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
About him?
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
I know.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
The tickets.
Sorry, babe.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Hi, beautiful.
Now.
But Dad --
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
I've got to go.
Alice!
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
You disappointed in me?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Alice...
Very funny.
Sobering...
How was the meeting?
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
I'm so sorry, honey...
It's just across the park.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
To take a picture.
Where are we going?
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Dad!
No.  A deal's a deal.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn\'t want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
He sure loves to stay awake.
So did Dan.
You do good work, Alice.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
But how are we gonna --
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
What?
If they actually bothered to bury her.
You think that's the place she's buried?
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
That's the only reason you're alive...
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Krueger is reality.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
What's that got to do with it?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Did everyone call everyone?
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Had kind of a long night.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
I don't understand.
No shit.
Poor woman...
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
But I've seen her grave.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Meaning?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
That's their problem.
They think I'm nuts.
Then we'll find another way.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Where are you going?
I don't know!
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
What, you named it already?
My baby!
Who's Jacob?
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Nobody thinks that.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Mark!
Then get out!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I thought about that.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Mark, are you okay?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I've got to write some of this down.
Well we gotta do something!
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Who?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
My undying love.  Have some.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
All of us.  Right?
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
I want to talk about the baby.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Yeah...
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Makes you look like a nun--
These things are wild...  What do you think?
He invited me to his house last night.
You, too?
Stick around, please?
It's okay.
I can't listen to this.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
Mark...
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Faint.
Vomit?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
I don't know.
But if they <u>do</u>?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Yes?
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
I'd sooner swim!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Unidentified Flying Objects.
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
My father!  He's not - ?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
What is it?
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You could train someone else.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
How is he - ?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Dave - !
Oh it does???
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Well?
We'll have to look for them later.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Somewhere down there?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
The sound again?
You hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Listen!  Hear that?
Yeah?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
I think you're right.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
'Us?'
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
We're stuck tight!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Cyclops?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
A lot of people think like that.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
So?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
I guess.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Huh?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
So they caught up with you, too?
Reef!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
We hope!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
The frogmen?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Right at our one-eyed friend!
What course, Skipper?
What???
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Course and speed?
I...don't know!
What about down?
Seems to be all around...
Is there any way out of it?
Right, Skipper.
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
What????
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Why do you say that?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Something wrong?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Yes, Griff?
Excuse me, Skipper---
What about time...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Anything ---
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Now they feel it...down below.
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Wonderful!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
All ready?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
There's got to be an explanation!
As we near the Pole...
What direction does the system indicate?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Under <u>water</u>?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Minus three.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Nothing we can do, now.
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
What?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
But - what can we accomplish?
That's what I said!
Right <u>at</u> him?
Thirty-four seconds!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
After torpedo room:  Report!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
What do you think?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
Huh?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Who with?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Obviously.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Why?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
He did!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Swell!
- for horrors like yourself?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
That's a <u>face</u>???
Come where?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
All right - go to it.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Toward the Pole!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
I'll be another!
Well, I'll be - !
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
See what?
Thank you.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
No.
Twombley involved?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
You don't believe me?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Always has been.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Are you alright, Wade?
No. Black.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Chub says you're fired.
Tell me.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Yeah. I know about that.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Same old shit.
What are you boys up to?
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Oh.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Yes.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
This spring.
How soon?
I plan to. Soon.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
That was me.
We bought you.
You can't buy Wade off.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
He's on to us!
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
You see it?
Yeah.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You heard the news.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Deers have ears too.
Sun's gettin high.
This way.
Yeah.
Safety on?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
What happened?
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Hmm.
They said.
Really.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Oh.
Double A. New Britain.
You played for the Sox?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Yeah?
I used to play ball.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I'm okay.
Wonderful!
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Mmm.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You think so.
You might not kill it.
Yeah.
If you get it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Damn straight!
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Guaranteed, eh?
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Open the door. We're late.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door, will ya?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Lawford?
I'm fucking out of here.
He sure as hell won't.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Yeah.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Saw him do it?
What?
Sure you did.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
On your sleeve.
What blood?
Where'd you get the blood?
Yeah.
You stayed away?
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
No, I mean whereabouts.
In the chest.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Piece of fucking cake.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Shit.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Right!
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Like you and Gordon?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
How'd you get the job?
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Not here.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
No brag. Just fact.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Don't mind if I do.
Okay, let's go home, then.
I want to go home.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Oh.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
You're a policeman.
I know.
That's illegal, you know.
You can't.
I want to go home.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
What are you sorry for?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Fine.
Okay.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Nothing.
What do you want, then?
No.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
How about a Big Mac?
Oh.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Pop?
It belongs to Pop.
It's pretty old.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Are we going in this?
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Dad.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
That\'s all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Jesus, why?
Yes.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
I called Mommy.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
No what?
No.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
It's fun.
It's stupid.
What then?
It's not that.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
I don't want to.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I just think you used to be bad.
What are you talking about?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
But it's not funny now.
To us it was.
Was it funny?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I guess they're stupid.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Break stuff?
You know.
Do what?
Why do they do that?
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
I don't care. They're out.
Those are the Hoyts.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Yeah.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
The key, Wade.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Could be.
You and Mel Gordon?
Maybe.
I won't. You interested?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Want to buy?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
You? Why?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
So?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
What do I have to do for it?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
On what you pay me?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
I'm fine, fine.
How you holding up, Wade?
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
Yeah. A few things.
Something bugging you?
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Like hell.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You mean Twombley?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
I figured you already heard.
Huh?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
What's the hurry?
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Fuck you.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
I'm not saying that.
You don't want the extra police pay?
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Don't go playing policeman.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Huh?
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Where's the plow?
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
No problem. Look, I...
Hi honey.
See. Get your boots.
Yeah, lots.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
It's just...
We've done all our talking, Wade.
We should talk.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Yeah.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Where's Jill?
Lillian!
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
I still don't understand --
Mel Gordon.
Good. Who?
I know who it is.
Did you get his number?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Going somewhere, Margie?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What happened?
Wade.
This is nuts.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
How?
Of course! I would've heard.
Think they're alright?
Strange.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
I know your parents.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Good.
Alright. I'll think about it.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
You've been married twice --
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Oh, Wade.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Then... I guess you have to.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
It's nice.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
What way?
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
You knew me as a kid.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
But not now.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack doesn't need money.
Money.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Okay.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Call me.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Yeah. I mean that.
You don't mean that.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Said what?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Okay. She's fine.
How's she doing?
For a while.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Can --?
It makes me sad.
Is...? She's dead then?
When did she die?
Coffee's perked.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
You're not using it today?
There's a furnace.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Hold on!
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
What the hell are you talking about?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
How's that?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Can't it wait, then?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Something about my father?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Who are you?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
He got his deer yet?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
His office. You mean my old office.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Where... how'd you hear that?
The other guy.
Jack?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
You talked to Jack?
Marg! You got orders!
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Marg!
Aw, c\'mon, I was only saying there\'s something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that\'s all. The sign\'s fine. What it says is wrong.
This town sucks.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
What?
It don't look right.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Take care, Wade.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Crawl!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
You and me.
Bang!
Yeah.
Everything you know is from me.
Call it what you want.
Love! I'm made of love!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
In the living room.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Yeah.
She's coming.
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Sleeping.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You no-good pup!
Nothing.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Atta-go.
Just do it.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Rolfe.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
For what?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
Wade, are you alright?
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
That's what you think.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Well, I never heard that one.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Yeah.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Not particularly.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
A hunting accident is perfect.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
I don't know. You tell me.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Money.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Then who shot him?
That it wasn't an accident.
Which is?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Find them everywhere. 
Want to know what I think happened?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
What about her?
What about Margie?
Yeah. I forgot.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Get some sleep.
Yeah, I guess.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
What happened?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Who?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
How was she?
The night before the shooting.
Huh?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Well, it was an accident.
You think Jack shot him?
No shit.
Twombley.
Who?
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Wade?
Rolfe.
Jim... for godsake!
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Yes dear?
Mom?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
That's not really the point.
Some kids were teasing you?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Your father never means to be so...
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
I'm sorry, honey.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
Back at The Fishbowl?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Alice...
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Don't you even want to ask?
I'm sure he's busy.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Yeah, no duh.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
He didn't leave us.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
I don't drink coffee.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
There they are!
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
Been better, Dad... You?
How you doing, sweetie?
Alice... I...
Daddy...
Daddy...
Alice!
How `bout a hug for the old man.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Hey, you guys back already?
Oooooh, I'm good.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Did we warn them off?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
It's cut.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Got it.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Lemme take a look.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Uh, we got a problem here.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
How we doing, Colonel?
Stay cool.
Got it.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
I'm doing what I can.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
He's busy being dead.
Put your pilot on.
You read my mind.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
I prefered the terrorists.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
This doesn't make sense.
They aren't answering their hails.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
We don't know that.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Sir, you threw out page two.
To swear you in as President.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
But they start executing hostages in
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Can we do that?
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
My loyalty was never to my country.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Because it is my duty.
Why?
Yes, Mr. President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Ga get it.
That's affirmative.
Roger.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Where are we now?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
We're not going to make it.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
How?
Well it worked.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
why did they do that?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
A secret service agent. It must be.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Who did this?
Any of us?
Nine.
How many others killed?
Dead.
The rest of the secret service?
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
We've already been inspected.
Copy, Air Force One.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Tower, here.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Scared. We're scared.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Thank you.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
And all these rooms here?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
A dubious distinction, no?
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Three...
Jim...
Four...
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Say something dear.
No.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
That was war.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
How can you? I mean they're people.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Yes
Do you have to be so brutal?
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
My husband is a very courageous man.
I know he left you behind.
What do you know of my husband?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Leave my daughter alone.
Come on, Alice.
Now, or he dies, please.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
What do you want with us?
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Hold on, Alice.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
There goes your ride.
One thing I've learned as
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Good. Good.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
You'll do it?
Stop.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Over my dead body.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Finally, we can bargain.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Twenty minutes?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
That isn't necessary.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Yes, sir.
I'll not going without my family.
Got it.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Gravity.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
They've gotta be joking.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Flying the plane.
What are you doing?
Both of you.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Please... don't start with me.
I don't know why you stayed.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
How did your speech go?
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I wish it were that easy...
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I miss you. And I miss her.
What?
You know what?
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Can't it wait?
May I speak to you for a moment?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Someone should give you a raise.
White House Situation room.
Where are we sending it?
No. I thought about this, Mr.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
and if that means negotiating...
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Did they say anything about my family?
Two... THREE. GO!
But...
One.
We're handling it, sir.
Where's my family?
We're under attack.
What's going on?
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Yeah, right.
This is the President.
who can I say is calling?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
WE'RE HOOKED!

I love these challenges @mytrainerbob 2 part Weekend Challenge http://shar.es/mo0Yc

Enjoyed a nice salad, steamed asparagus and some chicken for dinner :) Keepin it healthy! First meat I've had since Wed!
@allyeigh I have AOL but never use it, typically only use Yahoo :)
You would think the fact that as soon as I finish up my A&P stuff my spring break starts would be incentive enough to get to it! :P

@DonnieWahlberg if you follow me I promise not to DM you my number, or any other silly non sense :)
Waiting for the Peds Resident to come in, likely be told to stick with what we are doing, and go home... Tristan is sleeping :( poor kid!
Tristan's Neuro called this AM... We might be headed back on Monday, going to see how the weekend with antibiotics goes! #sickofdoctors!
Heading to the Ped this morning, Tristan still has a low grade temp, and complaining about his head :P
Home in about 5mins I already hear my bed calling out for me!
Heading home, follow up with Ped in AM, Neuro in a week, and will be calling the Uro... This boy has too many docs! Adding PT and Ortho too!
@JonathanRKnight http://tweetphoto.com/12528752 OMG you are flippin hilarious!
Heading home soon... T has some sort of infection, likely not his shunt... Confused doctors can be amusing :p
Guess we are heading home with no real answers... Gonna have to call Uro, Neuro and Ped in the mornin :p
I'd send the pic of Tristan I just took, but he would kille me! :) Still waiting of course
Waiting for results... Fever dropped a little
T's fever is getting worse even with meds, gonna do some blood work and shunt series (xrays of his shunt)

Tristan is such a boy I told him to take a shower his reply... I'm just washin my hair! :p

Will be doing school work ALL day... I did drop one of my classes though, so that makes for a lil less! :p
Waking up with a headache is a sure sign I did not sleep well!
OK sleepy time... Ill offend some more people tomorrow...:)
@allyeigh I lose a lot of followers... I think I offend people easily LOL
This is me studying... im so good at it, I can tweet at the same time... probably why I failed my Lab Practical!
Watching desperate housewives and busting up! Hilarious!
Watching @DonnieWahlberg makes it even better! RT @thepioneerwoman: Band of Brothers is perfection on the small screen. Absolute perfection.
I am happy to say I got a new battery for my blkberry and so far it is fairing much better than the original! Thank Goodness!

@cggarcia I ended up searching to see his @replies... lots of offers! HAHA Would be awesome if he did take someone up on it!
@JonathanRKnight Not yet, but I want to... Maybe we could go together?! ;)
Im not getting a tech job...quit telling me I need one 2b a nurse, I have a special needs son, that involves more experience than a tech!
@SunshineODT maybe a little... LOL
I think my nerves are getting to me, my belly is not feeling so well!
@WheelchairMommy I actually have the news on, all they can talk about is Tiger Woods, and his press conference today! :P
Why must we dedicate so much news time to a Lion errr I mean Tiger :P
@joeymcintyre I am addicted to Wild Cherry Pepsi, i keep trying to quit... I'm weak and never last long!

NKOTB tweeters - @krisfitz7 @jknddubangel @allyleigh

At school on my day off, need some peace and quiet to study... With wifi so hitting the library!
@TheFatBoys awesome! Thanks :)

My day was draining... tomorrow will be my Study day! Lots to get accomplished!
@DeborahGibson LOL I have someone my phone likes to call as well.... not nearly as interesting as Tiffany though!
@WheelchairMommy This morning! I RT'd something yesterday, so that may be why!
@sarah_janes Still trying to take this all in, I am so careful, i dunno how I missed this one! :p
@sarah_janes thanks for the reminder! According to the shunt manufacture the magnet has to get within 6 inches of the valve!
I don't wanna brag but @rachaelrayshow is following me... I'm a little excited about that, I LOVE her!
Oh and have I mentioned lately that #hydrosucks!
Working on putting a blog post together about Magnets! :) May seem silly but it could be life saving to someone with a programmable shunt!
@allyeigh me too, and it's such a simple fix :)
@allyeigh Apparently those big headphones (like they use at school) have magnets in them. His shunt his magnetic, so they cause it to reset!
Tristan's shunt needed to be reset, after trying to figure out why it keeps resetting itself, we may have found the cause - headphones!
Scan done waiting to see PA now... Its been a long day!
At the hospital waiting for Tristan's scan!
@SunshineODT sleep well!
@krisfitz7 LOL I tweeted before NK did! Besides you people tweet a lot! ha ha
I have arrived at school... Good times!
It's not personal... if it was id unfollow, block and unlist! :)
NK fans I usually unfollow because they tweet the guys A LOT and it fills up my home page causing me to miss tweets from others
Note... Just because I unfollow you does not mean I do not like you... I still have you in my lists
@DonnieWahlberg I will not be lurkin late! Have a fab evening, and watch out for @JonathanRKnight's balls! :p
@JKnDdubAngel HMMM I can so relate to that tweet!
@jefftimmons98 I agree about St. Louis! :)

@DAW69 BUT they are so comfy! Haha no worries I stuck with jeans, NK tee and hoodie!
At school.... And I wore the jeans! :p
Wonder if it would be totally wrong to wear my PJ pants to school! Ha
@jennaonpurpose did you read my tweet about my snoring husband?! LOL
Hubby snores while I tweet! My life is so glam, don't be jealous ;)

@JenLefler I never even got a tracking number....@ratties is still waiting for it to change to fulfilled!
I must be getting sleepy... my tweets are starting to sound like someone uneducated wrote them!
@JenLefler What? You and @ratties both! Hubby ordered mine 2/5! I cannot believe you two do not have your copies yet!
@DonnieWahlberg I have not Bball team I love... maybe I should start loving the Celtics??
@mandisaofficial NO! Drives me insane, and I cannot watch Wed night TV....

@jquesmith Only if I work out a lot and watch every bite that goes in my mouth! I was blessed with "big" genes.... :P

@jquesmith Roma's Pizza... I'm a simple girl who would rather be fat and happy, than skinny and hungry!
@WheelchairMommy True I am just saying there is no reason to not review something if you paid for it, id trust the opinion more in that case
@JonathanRKnight Cookie Monster?? ;)
I tweeted about needing to go to the Bathroom earlier and got reminded to wash my hands by @toiletbot totally made me LOL
I totally do not understand why blkberry designed this curve to blink its LED when the batt is low... defeats the purpose of reserving power
@WheelchairMommy I think a review is more reliable from someone who paid for something, than one from someone who got it for free!

@allyeigh I was wondering if you would! I noticed a few people but some flashed so quick
@DonnieWahlberg I have 2 words: I'm Impatient! LOL Ask my hubby he will tell ya!
Stupid taco bell forgot to put my food in the bag :P hubby went back...I'm starvin!
@JennyfromMTV put the phone out of reach on silent, problem solved! That's the rule for my 16yr old!
Taco Bell for dinner YUM! :)
@JKnDdubAngel I searched every nook and cranny they could fit one into... more than once! Shocked I have not checked again today LOL
Good Question!!! RT @JenLefler: why does @nkotb have to add more shows in same cities instead of new cities?!?
No more anatomy for now, im feeling cruddy again! :(
@ratties UMMM It's Lincoln's b-day Lots of schools out or half days!
OK enough annoying my followers... at least the non NK fan ones :) Time for some Anatomy!
@jordanknight I'd ask ya to get me, but that would assume you see this in the sea of tweets!
@RocksicleLover why would the 3rd show get canceled?
@krisfitz7 I have a NK name, I think you are following that one! :) But I never take the time to log onto it unless Im really bored!
@LoriB73 i think a road trip will be in order HAHA
@LoriB73 Hey its in first place!! How exciting is that!
just voted "Video 2" on "Who should win a wknd w/ Donnie Wahlberg? thelabonline.tv" vote too ? http://bit.ly/cd2pUj
@NKOTB A third show?! Why not just mosey down a lil south to STL instead!
@LoriB73 Crap! I was really hoping you were the lucky one!
@JenLefler Oh yuck! I hope it goes away quickly!
My 4yr old just sat a piece of candy in front of me and told me not to bite it.... man that was tough!
@kidsinchicago Thanks!
Wonders if @jordanknight was any good at Chemistry in High School?? Maybe he could tutor me ;)
Suggestions for a pair of decent in ear headphones, that don't cost a fortune??
@jordanknight No E! news for me (Don't have that channel)... please retweet the link when ya get it! :)
250 bucks for in ear headphones??? Seriously... Now now I know I paid no where near that!
@DAW69 Oh well... sheesh you'd think one of us would get lucky.... maybe itll be @lorib73!
@DAW69 Is the mail there yet??? :)
My dog chewed up my iPod headphones, looking for some new ones, and thinking "Did I really pay that much for mine" the answer is likely yes!
@dannywood Awww Your bubbletweets are the best! :)
@dannywood I already got an awesome Vday gift... My Coming Home DVD... I have a smart hubby! :) But Im not opposed to another...
@NKOTB The selling out of these shows should be a hint... we need a tour! ;) Seriously I just need you to come to STL, The Pageant is nice!
@Charla_v ick that would definitely cause a migraine for me! Of course these days everything triggers a migraine! LOL
@DAW69 Mine came via USPS... good ole postal service. Was in my mailbox!
@Charla_v at least with actual instruments they eventually start sounding pleasant... recorders never do!
@MoxieMel I asked him what song, he said none LOL I guess they are just practicing the different notes!
@ratties I say stay in bed :)
I have been listening to my son practice his recorder non stop for days... why must music instructors torture parents?!
Crap my 10,000th tweet was suppose to go to @jordanknight, instead it went to me drooling over Colby on Survivor! OOPS!
@WheelchairMommy I did not give away any details! :)
@TanyaLikesPink I am taking 5 classes, and decreasing my load would mean delaying entry into the nursing program :( it kind of sucks
I wonder if Colby tweets?! HMMM Must find out! - don't care if he wins, as long as he sticks around awhile! Haha #survivor
Oh Colby how I've missed you! #survivor
Tyson.... What on earth are you wearing?! LOL #survivor And my no is now a phew that was close!
NOOOOO #survivor :(
@JonathanRKnight why do you have friends who still get stoned at your age?! I drop those punks years ago!
Time for #survivior! :)
@simplyshannon I don't cry over these things... But I admit I shed a few tears! I am blaming @JonathanRKnight! :)
@SherriEShepherd I gotta know.... Did you get the @nkotb Coming Home DVD??
@jordanknight Got my DVD today, along with my crotch swatch! :) It totally rocks!
@joeymcintyre it was probably watching the DVD that brought this convo on! :)
@joeymcintyre i caught my 4yr old "chatting" with you on the phone today... Apparently she thinks you are coming to visit with Griffin! ;)
Thank you @nkotb! The video was amazing!
Watching DVD :) Oh the memories!
@mcintyresweete YAY glad you got your mac pac FINALLY! LOL

@ratties There is tutoring available... when I am in my chem class :P I guess it is for everyone else... I am doing everything else I can do
I am failing Chemistry... I have never failed a class or even come close... this stresses me out more than I can put into words!
Totally stressing over school :( I think its making me sick!
@simplyshannon it was probably just a spammer anyway

I am exhausted... we will leave it at that!
At school... All the Elementry/high schools are out but not us :(
Long wait :( my head hurts I just wanna lay down!
Migraines suck booty.... Having to goto the er and get a shot for it sucks even more booty
I confessed I knew about DVD :) Hubby said he was wondering how long it would take me to find out! Haha
@LoriB73 @MomofLoganElla I think a viewing party would be a blast!
@NicLNew Maybe yours is taking a lil longer because they needed to put the golden ticket in there?? ;)
@MomofLoganElla YAY!! Maybe they are shipping them state by state LOL

Fulfilled... that is all...

They all have specific purposes, so I do understand, but I am seeing people with several accounts for 1 purpose, spamming celebs!
Oh and before anyone jumps on me, I do admit to having 3 accounts, this one (main use), a Nk one and one for my Photog biz!
@WheelchairMommy I have seen several people with several accounts to tweet 5 certain men. Some create accounts for each celeb they spam!
@MzMcLean I admit to having 3, this one, NK one, and one for my photog biz... they all have specific purpose... the ones Im seeing do not!
How many twitter accounts does 1 individual need? I get having more than one, but seriously am seeing people with 4+ for no apparent reason!
@JonathanRKnight Bonfire at your place? looks like you have enough land to fit us all there for hot dogs and smores!
It is now snowing! The ground is all wet from the rain... this is lovely weather!
Dear Smokey the cat, I know you want out, but you must understand that I am not allowing it in your best interest, so quit growling at me!
@zimmtv Are you tweetviding and driving?? tsk tsk!
I am not doing well in my science classes, and it is really depressing me!
@SunshineODT OH computer training sounds like fun! :P

@WheelchairMommy I designed mine... Simple... Forget where I had them printed! Ill have to check!
@WheelchairMommy Naaa I think Jon is to smart to follow fans! LOL The others are being Dm'd to death!

Mentioned to hubby my @NKOTB DVD hunt and he got noticably upset.... Told me I better not buy it cause I mentioned I wanted it for vday! :)
FYI Tristan is having surgery tomorrow to get his tonsils out... Will be updating throughout the day via twitter & Facebook
Awww just watched my boys on Jimmy Fallon :) Gotta get that DVD!
According to target's website, the coming home dvd is only available online!
@ratties Wonder what wal mart does have it! On the website they wont let you check that, like you can with most things! :P
@ratties AMEN to that, I am ticked Wal Mart does not have the DVD in stores!
@TheFatBoys 1000 bucks? Easy Buy the @nkotb dvd then put the rest away for nursing school!
@sarah_janes I did not even bother going all the way to Target! :(
No dvd not even a spot for it!
Anyone need This is it?! Plenty of those :p

@peoplemag I don't believe her! Unless she was hypnotized... then maybe!
@allyeigh Crap I was at walmart today and totally forgot to go look for the DVD!
@JKnDdubAngel If I recall correctly Jeff studied Psychology in College :) Too bad that was last semester for me!
@DonnieWahlberg I barely have time to tweet, let alone spam you! I guess some people lead boring lives :P
@jordanknight You are by far the biggest tease I know... I bet your mom was always yelling at you for teasing your siblings!! :P
Ever feel like you need to eat to feel better, but know that eating could just make it worse :( Yea that's me today...
@jordanknight I DVR'd it, wanna come over and watch together?? :)
Ended up not going to class...I hope my tummy feels better soon!
I feel like crud... but going to Chem anyway! :(
@JenLefler It's my anniversary weekend & considering we did not get to spend it together last yr, doubt he will let me go see @nkotb this yr
Applying for nursing schools is costing me an arm and a leg!
Sad... just found out one of the nursing schools I am applying to is moving its campus... would add to my commute quite a bit :(
Will not be staying up for @jimmyfallon tonight, but did set the DVR! Can't wait to see @nkotb perform!
@dannywood I wanna come to MIA! I miss Sun, I miss warmth... Winter is almost over...
Blasting @attaboyonline Check them out... they really rock!
@NicLNew I noticed! RCMH is kind of small too isnt it? I don't mind small venues, and I am sure it is all business! Bigger venues cost more
@LoriB73 I think so too as well as Hope... Verizon was pretty much sold out last summer, i dunno how they could not come here!
Hello Migraine... so sweet of you to just pop up out of now where with no warning :P
@NicLNew If I could talk my husband in to it... I so would... unfortunately it would require me missing our anniversary! LOL
I have a Bio exam online to take during the same 24 hours I will be dealing with a 10yr old having surgery... Fun! :P
I tried really hard not to googlemap directions to Hammond, IN but the urge could not be resisted... FYI only about 5 hours away!
Sophie is gonna be with a sitter 4 days this week... that never happens!
Science used to be easy... then I took 10yrs off school... Now not so much!
Before I log off to study... I just gotta say I <3 @jordanknight @dannywood @joeymcintyre @jonathanrknight & @donniewahlberg

UMMM just saw MJ's kids... Someone needs to lock up Paris... She is gorgeous!!! Hopefully Papa Jackson has a shotgun! HAHA
@JonathanRKnight Oh man... I hope you find some way to get some rest! Maybe its time to switch to decaf!
@JKnDdubAngel That's my job! :P I wanna be full time, you can be my assistant! HAHA
The Rockettes come to STL every December... therefore @nkotb should come visit us too!
OK going to bed... night everyone!
@MzMcLean I am so missing the grammy's... say GD in concert for the first time last year... by far the best concert ive ever been to :)
So thinking I need to talk my hubs into letting me go visit some friends in Toronto with a lil of that tax refund we are getting!
@SunshineODT I guess he missed the pants on the ground song!
@TheFatBoys That's why DVR was invented! ;)
@jordanknight People are talking about a big surprise???
@SunshineODT fafsa.ed.gov Mine was not to bad, of course a lot of my info from last year was stored :)
@SunshineODT Doesn't matter file anyway, the sooner the better, especially for some of the smaller state funded grants!
@SunshineODT Now go file your FAFSA! :) LOL
@SunshineODT DO IT! We did and I am still in shock over the refund amount!
Listening to @joeymcintyre and my 4yr old tells me to stop anytime I start tapping my foot, singing or anything else I get the urge to do!
@jimmyfallon I will be watching... the next morning ;) Set the DVR, just a little late for me to be up!
I'm #proudofnkotb for treating all their fans like family :) Yup! 5 Brothers and a Millions sisters!
@JonathanRKnight That was not an image I needed in my head before bed!
@JonathanRKnight WOW 8 hours ago.... I think I might watch out for them! Craziness!
@LoriB73 if @jordanknight comes to your house... all us BTTW girls are crashing in! LOL
@JonathanRKnight Dude seriously? Guess you are squeaky clean! I have a basement that needs some work if you are that bored! ;)
@dannywood What is one supposed to do when they are being bombarded by shots, but no longer drinks?! hmmmm
I am upgrading to Win7Pro... Hope I don't regret this!
@DonnieWahlberg I have decided that NKOTB needs to have a couple shows in STL, we are right in the middle of the country!
@DonnieWahlberg A shot of chocolate milk ;)

Good question! @NKOTB I want an answer :) @allyeigh: @DonnieWahlberg Aren't the golden tickets only in the Deluxe DVD?
@allyeigh you will be 2 hours late... 435EST -4 335CST
@WheelchairMommy What did you do??
I need to quit facebooking, its an odd 2 degrees of separation thing... I swear I know someone, who knows someone id rather them not know!
I think I have changed my mind about applying to chamberlain...
Just realized the bonus to Sophie having a sick day... I get to see @nkotb live on the @todayshow YAY... Feeling a lil better now!
@nicoleseitler Awwww I wanna go! Have fun, and tell everyone I say Hi!
@allyeigh Joe went off on someone?! I need to quit this nursing school stuff and get back to the school of NK ;)
@dannywood @donniewahlberg @jordanknight Thank you... Now I have that song stuck in my head! :P Guess I need to turn some @nkotb on!
To anyone wondering about the twitvid... go here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNtTEibFvlQ
@mandisaofficial ummm wow that would be awkward!
Excited about going to Chamberlain tomorrow!
I was not whining I swear! ;) RT @hollyphotog WINER!
@WheelchairMommy OH LOL I was at school, so didnt see the first one sig figs= significant figures beyond that you gotta figure it out urself
@WheelchairMommy Why were you telling me to shut up?? Sig Figs really do confuse me LOL
Sig figs confuse me
The guy sitting in front of me smells like liquor.... Wonder what he did last night :p
Aren't you cute... errr Cheesy.... Or something ;) http://tweetphoto.com/9783714
@WheelchairMommy No credits on my view of it, are they on the bottom?? Probably got cut off since I am on a smaller screen.
@WheelchairMommy OMG the look on WIll's face in that pic has me cracking up! He is to cute! :) Cute background... Whose paper??
Who wants to cruise?? You could do it with Boyz II Men, and even have your wedding vows renewed! http://www.boyziimencruise.com/
Well Chamberlain finally called, meeting with them on Friday... Took my app out of the mail box to take with me LOL
Off to the math class I am likely going to drop :p don't need it for the schools I am applying to!
OK i think I am just going to send my app off to chamberlain... I am positive I can get in!
@SunshineODT Id have to be sitting behind them, otherwise Id never see any of the movie, id keep turning around! LOL
@JKnDdubAngel I am jealous! You get to do all the fun stuff... Me thinks I need to move closer to NYC! HAHA
I bet chamberlain calls today while I am in class :p
@dannywood I'm headed to Chemistry! Have fun in Seattle :)
OK... kid to school, then me to school, hopefully this week will be a bit less exhausting than last week!
@JKnDdubAngel When you assume you make an ass out of u and me ;)
Nothing from Chamberlain yet... I am so impatient! LOL
@DonnieWahlberg About your BubbleTweet... http://bbltwt.com/axv73 - Did @worldofjohnny take those scissors to your hair? ;)
Not looking forward to the debt nursing school is going to cause, thank goodness most hospitals have loan forgiveness!
@DonnieWahlberg I'm "Listening" :)
@SunshineODT EWWW front row sucks... But you will get through it!
Just set the DVR for @todayshow on Friday! Excited to see @NKOTB again, I know Today Show usually means an exciting announcement!
Hoping I get my call from Chamberlain today! I really want to get my app sent off!
@SunshineODT Oh sounds like a fun day! :p Congrats on the new job!
@aplusk preparing for retirement again?! :p
Oh I should mention its prohibited from the class... Hubby could care less if I use it
Everytime I ask hubby for help with my Math, he pulls out the calculator I am not allowed to use! :p
Any bets on Farve retiring again?
Totally missed the news about @nkotb being on the @todayshow yet again! I need to quit studying so hard and pay more attention to twitter.;)
Had a crazy dream that @DonnieWahlberg was observing my A&P Lab class...I was very distracted and then had to  (cont) http://tl.gd/536ls
I love @jason_mraz! If you have direct tv they are playing his performance from Farm Aid right now!
Watching farm aid on direct tv.... It was recorded at Verizon Wireless... OH the memories!
@SunshineODT I may just stay at CC I am at and get my ADN, BUT these two schools will have me done with a BSN in the same amount of time!
@SunshineODT I sent my app off for Barnes-Jewish today, and have my app for Chamberlain all ready to go (waiting for their rep to call)
Thanks for the well wishes on my Nursing school app :) I also applied at Barnes Jewish (my first choice!)
@hollyphotog Your Studio is nearly as big as my house is!
@SunshineODT Congrats! I have been doing nursing school apps! I looked at Maryville, that's where you are applying right?
@JKnDdubAngel I hope their kids are 18.... Guess they missed that you had to be 18!
Working on my application for Chamberlain nursing school! :)
@allyeigh its the new great pillow, I keep seeing commercials for it, full of micro beads :) Looks comfy!
I really want a sobakawa pillow! :)
@MacsSTLsweetie they just announced it today :) Not long before you asked what the 2 meant! :)
Mailing off my APP to Barnes Jewish College tomorrow... Wish me luck!
@MacsSTLsweetie They added a second date the Radio City Music Hall!
@WheelchairMommy YAY! Cannot wait to see the new floors!
@DonnieWahlberg I will be missing it, just cannot afford to travel to NYC, but will be there via twitter! :)
@NKOTB I am sittin on the edge of my seat here! Suspense is killing me HA HA!
@dannywood You guys are going to have an amazing year... I hope I get the chance to experience some of it!
#ff @spinabifidaIL @MSF_USA @RedCross
Bonus of not being able to travel for @nkotb shows... No ticket buying drama to deal with! HA
Just got a 93% on my first A&P quiz... guess all that studying paid off :)
@Flergs wow! That is bold! Sorry people are ripping you off... That's worse than giving it to people free IMO
RT @Flergs: New Estranged Collection now available and buy the Collection or full kit to get a freebie!http://bit.ly/8cxr2Q
@Charla_v UGH Sophie used to be like that! Drove me nuts!
Who tweeted from @joeymcintyre's show last night?  I need to catch up on the fun I missed!
@LoriB73 Now that is something to look forward to as well!
I keep trying to remind myself there are several reasons why I am not in Chicago to see @joeymcintyre, still bummed to be missing out though
@MacsSTLsweetie Wasnt there a pre-show meet up?! Go get warm!!
Gotta go get the new tags for our plates... so not looking forward to this!
Installing my new wireless card! Will be nice to be able to do homework on the couch again! Haha
Being around all these kids is comical!
@seanalgaier I though Jillian was awesome! I so love her... Wish I could have her training me! LOL
Should have dressed warmer it is freezing out and the walk from the parking lot to class is awful!
Dear online course instructors, please open up assignments ahead of time, at least 1... I like working ahead, then if im sick, Im still good
@jordanknight Good Morning... I intend to grow more brain cells today... Off to class in a bit, weird being in college at 30 something :)
@sarah_janes I hate it too!.... thankfully it just looks nasty here... no crud yet!
@simplyshannon I am absolutely sure you will! :) Wish I could be there! LOL
@MacsSTLsweetie No tweeting and driving! Have a great time in Chicago!
@simplyshannon Have a fantabalous day! :)
Up and ready to face the world! School again today, but only for an hour!
@JillianMichaels I loave watching you every week! But this week....even more so!
Watching biggest loser.... I love Jillian!
gonna run away!
2 the girls i asked help on finding a class today, who pointed me in the wrong direction when they KNEW I was in their class.. Karma is all!
Think I might smack someone! :p
Gonna have to dress warm.... Had to park out in thr middle of no where
On Campus today... good times!
RT @MSF_USA: http://twitpic.com/yq7gy At Carrefour hospital in #Haiti Doctors Without Borders surgical team did 90 (cont) http://tl.gd/499k9
Reading @msf_usa's tweets are making me frustrated... I wish I could do more, cannot wait till I am done with nursing school!
UMMM where was I when @jordanknight was doing all those bubbletweets? I should be sent to time out for being a bad Jordan girl!
@jordanknight She looks pissed LOL... no idea who snookie is though... this is a Jersey Shore thing right?
So far I am ahead of the game in my classes... let's hope I can keep that momentum up!
Dear children... QUIT screaming and driving each other nuts!!!
Stupid computer class... UMMM i think I know how to save a file... and don't need XP for that... Why do they make you take stupid classes!
@JonathanRKnight Awww we all love you, even if you cannot spell! :)
@SunshineODT I probably need to take that... but have not yet! Good Luck!
@DonnieWahlberg I hate it when you dont add spaces.. twitter does not break the line, and I cannot see the whole thing! LOL
I think its weird when people who tweet a lot just up and delete their pages without a word... #justsayin
@SunshineODT so what class did you have today? I had A&P :) Good times!
On my way home and starving!
First day of class and already looking at sheep brains!
@jordanknight Looking good as usual! :) Have a great evening, and enjoy yourself where ever you are!
Ok going to hang with my honey!
@jonathanrknight you should do an Official Facebook FAN Page... nothing personal, but then the fakes would have competition! :)
@MacsSTLsweetie Use a command like "Go Potty" every time... she will get the hang of it! Eventually she will go on command!
@MacsSTLsweetie Crate her... when you cannot be keeping a close eye on her, put her in it, other times take her out every 30mins
@JonathanRKnight I cannot wait to watch either... unfortunately I have to! LOL
@DonnieWahlberg I'd be honored if you followed me... I won't even spam your DM box :)
@joeymcintyre If there was a way... I would so be there!
@DAW69 Hi Anita... nice to see a tweet from you! Good Luck!
@JeffTimmons98 So wish I could be there... Hopefully lots of people will be tweeting so I can enjoy it through them!
@daxholt The Impact? :) Nice...
@DonnieWahlberg I can't wait either... Hopefully you will be coming somewhere close so I can go!
http://twitpic.com/y86co - @joeymcintyre just right click and save, should be the right size now!
@joeymcintyre Oh Joey... you are so cute!... I can resize anything for you if need be... just gotta dm me! :) I am a photog so its what I do
@MzMcLean true! :)
@MzMcLean Pretty sure he only reads my emails HAHA I never get his attention on here!
@joeymcintyre Any chance one of the video winners who could not make it, could get a follow as a consolation prize?? :)
@jordanknight HAHA that is funny! Did you tell him who you are? Or leave him guessin?
@Tabbicats I've already seen a couple! But no mass spammers yet at least!
Nk fans... make sure you read ALL the rules for the contest, only one entry, and your account must be public #amexnkotb
@insearchofnkotb According to the instructions, you are required to have your account set to public
So I wonder how many people did not fully read the instructions and will tweet it multiple times and be disqualified! HA!
Hi @americanexpress I want to meet NKOTB! My favorite song starts: I Know It's #AmexNKOTB
@MzMcLean True! And I could split hotel cost with someone since I'd get 2 tickets!
@MzMcLean I am afraid to enter... winning and not being able to go x2 would be heartbreaking :(
UMMM "I'm Waiting" is now my favorite @joeymcintyre song... I gotta see that live ASAP!
@joeymcintyre I am bummed I am missing out on these shows... But grateful I have twitter so I can be there in spirit! :)
@Jeffscuties I thought we had till 5pm? Not really fair to give so many a head start on voting!
@WheelchairMommy Just a bit ago LOL :) I still love ya... Hope you have a great day today!
@WheelchairMommy I am not @deenahageb I am @JustDeena! :)
@jordanknight Hey J-Train... Where is this train going?? And how is that album coming, would love a bit of an update!
@JeffTimmons98 Thanks Jeff, You rock!
Ok going to bed.... I am up wait to late... and cannot sleep in on Sat to catch up cause I have school! :P
I am tagging everyone in these old pics on Facebook... I am sure they will all unfriend me! LOL
@jquesmith #factaboutme - I've been homeless
Scanning pics....
@WheelchairMommy Definitely go and Meet Donnie if there is... tell him a crazy Blockhead from STL sent you! HAHA
@jordanknight Seeing everything down there has solidified my decision to strive to work for Doctors without Borders when I become a nurse!
@MzMcLean if we guess right is he gonna tell us?! LOL
@WheelchairMommy any chance there is a movie shooting in Austin?! Suspect a NK might be there haha!
Seriously?! Seems like Aid got there as quick as they could! RT @BreakingNews: Photographer witnesses corpses used (cont) http://tl.gd/3n24k
@DonnieWahlberg HMMMM Austin... Sounds kinf of like Boston :p
Tristan's play is about civil rights.... He goes to a school that is 99% white... HMMMM
Off to Tristan's Play... Good times, he is forbidding me from taking pics... He does not know me very well!
@tedstryker because I sleep when he is on... BUT what they are doing to him is crappy!
@Flergs Looks Gorgeous, Cannot wait to see the entire thing!
@JKnDdubAngel What class??
@WheelchairMommy I emailed you!
@WheelchairMommy Ill send it in a lil bit, trying to gather more professional info on it (I saw it on a forum posting)
@WheelchairMommy It is a surgery for those with neurogenic bladder due to Spina Bifida or SCI! If successful NO MORE catheters!
Astonished at science just read about the Xiao Procedure... It could honestly change Tristan's life!
@WheelchairMommy PS have you heard of the Xiao Procedure, I just read about it, and am in awe!
@WheelchairMommy If this was facebook I'd "Like" your tweet HAHA
@MacsSTLsweetie I wanna play bingo!
@jordanknight And just where are you going?? PS are you gonna goto the Joe Show??
@SherriEShepherd that DDub has a way with the ladies! :)

@dannywood You need to tweet more... #justsayin :)
@dannywood That's because we all love your love tips... even my hubby is a fan! (And he is a strict non-nkotb fan!)
@allyeigh She did a post about RR, that's what started all this being out and everyone discussing it http://nkotbsummer.blogspot.com/
@allyeigh Some bought Gold packages because those proceeds were to goto charity for a bit at one point... did you read KT's blog?
@allyeigh RR has collected money for a few supposed charities, in exchange for a donation a drawing w/prize was supposed to happen
@allyeigh I actually thought they were just running things poorly till that point... now I feel more like it's a big old scam
@allyeigh Yep that be it! The fact he is finding it simpler to reimburse charity money, rather than provide proof it went to charity...
I think I should have just let hubby drive himself to his buddies, and been without the car... I am so tired now :(
Came home and my dog acted like she had not seen me in months, kept throwing a fit till I laid down so she could lay down with me! LOL
I am up, all so I can drive hubby 5mins to his buddy's house so they can carpool to work!
@JKnDdubAngel Maybe we should combine the Marshmallow dropping of pants with #pantsontheground HAHA
@DonnieWahlberg Awww it is almost midnight... In Boston anyway!
Pat Robertson gives Christians a bad name, in tragedy we should come together and be compassionate, serving, like Jesus! NOT condemning!
And now the stomach bug has hit Kaitlyn... Oh joy!
@ratties LOL I was laughing at the britney spears guy... he cracked me up!
@ratties That video is awesome, the other one I saw was not as comprehensive! HAHA Sad I missed it!
@joeymcintyre Very tragic! My hearts and prayers go out to everyone effected by it!
@ratties I watched most of it, but had to head out and get kids for the last 30mins :)
@simplyshannon Ohh ok :)
@lancearmstrong they are horrifying! I have had to turn the news off and avoid it...All I can do is pray for them!
@irishgirl75 Thanks, I missed it and was wondering why everyone was talking about it!
@simplyshannon What ipod were you using before?
@jordanknight I must have missed that... Darn!
Making chocolate covered pretzels!
@WheelchairMommy It is strange, last week it would just say the town I was in.. Dunno why it went back to the numbers
@jordanknight The video was Hilarious, thanks for sharing!
@WheelchairMommy Might be longitude latitude, GPS nonsense... No idea LOL I know it changes all the time when I tweet from my phone
@WheelchairMommy You can text me too :P I get twitter everywhere... Location is defined by my Twitter App on my phone (Not sure how)
@WheelchairMommy It just all blends in together, so It never really seems like i live in just the town my house is in...did that make sense?
@JoeGrl_DdubTude My twitter slowed a lot when I quit following most BH on this account... It was kind of nice!
@WheelchairMommy I replied hehe... And my town is not that teeny... OK maybe the town I live in is, but the area is not! LOL
@WheelchairMommy Heading there now!
@jordanknight are you watching AI?! You should come tweet with us!
Awww they split them up :( #AI
OMG Package deal?! Dollar store?! LOL :P
I really hope this guy sucks!
Nevermind LOL I figured it out Huh? RT @funkyspice: @JustDeena or theyre pullin another "i need to be center of attention" stunt?
Huh? RT @funkyspice: @JustDeena or theyre pullin another "i need to be center of attention" stunt?

Mary is cracking me up! She could easily replace Simon!
Ok the insect was not that horrible! :)
Pretty sure guitar girl is gonna be a guitar dud :p
Watching AI with hubby!
Hubby is out of the shower... cuddle time for me, sleepy time for him I bet, he is exhausted!
Ok working on updating my blog... if you are a blogger DM or tweet me the link... mine is http://deenasuprema.wordpress.com
@MzMcLean It was awful, I would be seeing replies to people I follow, yet never saw their tweets!
@MzMcLean Probably along with the fact twitter was not showing me people's tweets that I follow normally :P
@MzMcLean I missed those tweets! LOL
@DonnieWahlberg Can we sing "Close to You" instead?! ;) hehe
@DonnieWahlberg secret acting location?! HMMM NK CIA is gonna find you, you know they will!!
@MzMcLean LOL I deleted my farm! I kept forgetting to harvest crops in time... also kept killing fish in fishville!
@MacsSTLsweetie Did you get the info about the pre party? @simplyshannon is putting it together!
Cops called to Speidi's house for possible kidnapping?! Any1 else excited that we may never hear from them again? http://tinyurl.com/ycswy2a
@MzMcLean I thought it was pretty funny, I took one down and she sniffed it, then was fine! :P Weird dog!
Here you go, someone explain it to me?! I put them up a couple days ago, she noticed them and started growling!  http://twitvid.com/F9D60
My dog keeps barking/growling at the pics of the kids on the wall!?
@jefftimmons98 I gotta say I am jealous! Wish I could be in LA.... Ill be freezing in the midwest instead LOL
That video I just retweeted... WOW! :(
@MacsSTLsweetie Dakota always chews the squeaker out of her toys!
@DonnieWahlbergTwugs Mr. Wahlberg... Enjoy your time out in Twitter Jail ;) I know you are headed there soon!
Going to attempt to upload a new background....
@DonnieWahlberg Just do it! :)
HMMM me thinks I need a new background now to go with new pic! Pink to match my computer...
And yes I like hiding behind things, why do you think I am a photog!
Just so yall know I changed my avatar :)
Hey look its me! http://twitgoo.com/biqmr
Going to attempt a self portrait today for #project365 :) Let's see now this pans out...
Concalent Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, Ionic Bonds.... Blah blah.... I love science but this is boring me!
@voverton You have missed a lot :)
All the kids are at school, Hubby is at work... That means quiet study time for me! :)
@jordanknight It's diet right? Bad habits are hard to break, I drink soda for breakfast too!
@JonathanRKnight Me and hubby honeymooned in Boston! Great City I cannot wait to go back, soon I hope! Its been almost 6yrs!
Hubby is going back to work in the mornin, so that means no sleeping in for me.... Off to bed I go :)
@DonnieWahlberg http://tweetphoto.com/8592485 So do ya still have that big button from STL?! :)
At the doc with Sophie, possible ear infection.... Hopefully my kids will all be healthy soon!
@DonnieWahlberg Need more info, you are scaring blockheads worldwide! Take care of yourself, we cannot have all this, without you! :)
@MTVAftershow @jordanknight LOL That is awesome! Wish I could see it!
@NicLNew Yes it is! Catch 22 though, it will only be for about a month, and he will miss out on a longer job closer to home :(
Hubby is going back to work tomorrow! :)
@TheFatBoys I did follow him! :)
@MacsSTLsweetie Thanks! I hear him snoring now... Poor kid!
Poor Tristan is so sick he can barely stand up :(
